# Advent of Code 2025

Small collection of solutions, done in Kotlin with Amper.

## Running a solution:

Plop your input into `src/inputs` and name it `Day01.txt` and so on.
If a day has two different inputs, name the second one `Day01-p2.txt` etc.

```sh
./amper run --main-class Day01Kt
```

Or if using the IntelliJ IDE, install the Amper plugin,
then right-click the source file for the specific day and click run.
